Game Off 2020 Game Jam Entry about lassoing asteroids and shooting space pirates

A simple little 2D demo for the Game Off 2020 game jam.
Control a little astronaut stranded in an asteroid field who can only slowly accelerate in one direction at a time.
Turning is done via rigidbody2d joint constraints or tethering onto stationary bodies in the vicinity

Code got progressively sloppier through the month
